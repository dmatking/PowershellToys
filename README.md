Interesting or ridiculously over-engineered command-line scripts. 

I wrote these in the script language versions below. Functionality may be a little different in each scripting language.

* PowerShell: 7.4.0 Core
* Bash: GNU bash, version 5.0.17(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
* Python: 
  * Linux: Python 3.11.2 (main, Mar 13 2023, 12:18:29) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
  * Windows: Python 3.9.13 (tags/v3.9.13:6de2ca5, May 17 2022, 16:36:42) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
* Windows Terminal: Version: 1.18.2822.0
* git: version 2.43.0.windows.1
* git: version 2.39.2 raspberry pi OS

* **Git Config Super Listing** - A color-coded listing of the git configuration properties for each environment (system, global, local) as well as an effective properties section. The effective properties section will show properties in the color of the environment from which they come or from which they are overridden. [Screenshot](images/gitconfigsuperlist.png)

* **Windows Terminal Multiple Launch** - Launch 2 or 4 pane windows terminal from command line, execute the given commands. Examples are for ssh to multiple machines and running htop. Handy if you need to monitor multiple servers.
